# ARM packages of OpenCBM
Experimental deb-Packages for Debian and Raspbian Linux (architectures armhf and armel)

These packages reflect the current development state at
https://github.com/opencbm/opencbm (master branch)

I have added some tweaks for a smoother Debian packaging experience. Those changes are available in a pull request. (https://github.com/OpenCBM/OpenCBM/pull/15)
